Key events such as the Battle of Gettysburg, the Emancipation Proclamation issued by President Lincoln in 1863 which declared all enslaved people in Confederate-held territory free, the Assassination of President Abraham Lincoln in 1865, and the surrender of General Lee to General Grant at Appomattox Court House marked crucial turning points.
